# HW3

- `hw3.ts` contains hw3.
- To submit, please push `hw3.ts` back to the repository.
    * DO NOT add `node_modules`.
- Your code needs to compile with no errors with
    ```
    tsc --strict --target es2019 --module commonjs hw3.ts
    ``` 
    This command will produce a file `hw3.js` which you can run with `node`.
    If your code does not compile, we will not grade your submission.
- You can run your compiled code with
    ```
    node hw3.js
    ```
