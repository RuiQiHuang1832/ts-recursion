# MIDTERM 

- Work on the midterm by yourself!!!!
- The midterm is open book, open notes, open internet.
- `midterm.ts` contains midterm.
- To submit, please push `midterm.ts` back to the repository.
    * DO NOT add `node_modules`.
- Your code needs to compile with no errors with
    ```
    tsc --strict --target es2019 --module commonjs midterm.ts
    ``` 
    This command will produce a file `midterm.js` which you can run with `node`.
    If your code does not compile, we will not grade your submission.
- You can run your compiled code with
    ```
    node midterm.js
    ```
